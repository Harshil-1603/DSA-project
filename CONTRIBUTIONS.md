# Team Contributions

Hey there! 👋 This is a quick rundown of what each of us worked on for the Test Centre Allotment Platform.

## The Squad

- **Harshil** (harshil.agrawal098@gmail.com)

## Harshil

Started things off with the project setup and README. Then dove into the graph construction algorithms - built the whole system for converting OpenStreetMap data into our graph structure with speed-based edge weights. Also handled the precomputation lookup tables for fast distance queries. Wrapped up by polishing the UI and fixing those last-minute bugs.

**DSA Focus:** Graph data structures, graph construction algorithms, priority queue implementations

---

## Atharva

Helped set up the project infrastructure and dependencies. Worked on graph algorithms - specifically the connected components computation to make sure our graph analysis is solid. Also did some cool optimization work like caching and removing redundant computations. Plus handled the contribution docs!

**DSA Focus:** Graph traversal algorithms, connected components, optimization techniques

## Harshit

Built the spatial side of things! Created the KD-tree data structure from scratch for efficient nearest neighbor searches. Implemented the Haversine distance calculations and all the geometry utilities. Also worked on the frontend with Fagun - handled the JavaScript logic and map integration.

**DSA Focus:** KD-tree data structure, spatial algorithms, geometric computations

## Fagun

Designed the core data structures (Student, Centre, Node types) and state management. Implemented the pathfinding algorithms - both Dijkstra and A* with bidirectional search. Built the greedy allotment algorithm with priority queues and tiered logic. Also collaborated on the frontend - worked on the HTML structure and API server integration.

**DSA Focus:** Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*), allocation algorithms, data structure design

## How We Worked Together

1. **Setup Phase** - Harshil & Atharva got everything ready
2. **DSA Phase** - All four of us split the algorithms and data structures evenly
3. **Frontend Phase** - Fagun & Harshit teamed up on the UI
4. **Final Touches** - Harshil polished everything up

Everyone got their hands dirty with some serious DSA work, and we made sure the contributions were pretty balanced across the board! 🚀
